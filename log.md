# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I am getting close to finishing my portfolio, it is modified Boostrap theme and this gave me a chance to finally learn how to use Github Pages which was on my list for like 6 months haha too fun :)

**Thoughts:** Somtimes got really frustrated with the style sheet. I want to get this thing up but in the near future I want to convert all of my styles to Sass. I also think there could be some better asset optimization.

### Day 1: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent my 2+ HRs on FreeCodeCamp powering through the HTML, CSS and Boostrap lessons :)

**Thoughts:** I had a decent amount of experience in all of these subjects and was surprised at how many simple techniques will help on future projects.

### Day 2: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent my hour today working through the jQuery lesson.

**Thoughts:** I once again had experience with jQuery but was refreshed by the clarity of the concepts. I feel like will use it to the fullest in the near future without blindly copy and pasting functions.

### Day 3: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the jQuery lesson and finished my portfolio site!

**Thoughts:** Revisiting jQuery was a real eye opener. I dont think there is much I couldnt figure out with it now :)

My portfolio is finally up and I am happy! Check it out BELOW

### Day 4: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first front-end project for FreeCodeCamp (YAZZZ)

**Thoughts:** I was suprised how fast I could stand up a basic Bootsrap page. If I can connect this to a CMS I could make a butt load of sites. Ive been a wordpress guy and realize I really hate PHP. Sorry not sorry.

### Day 5: January 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished a free site for an organization I help start called Lake Nona Tech.

**Thoughts:** It was fun project and I had fun putting some of our amazing past speakers on to the site :) This is a WordPress site.

### Day 6: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I am half way done with the FreeCodeCamp portfolio project. I already have one (see day 4) so I am making one for my wife Emily <3

**Thoughts:** It is strange making a portfolio for someone else but its makes me think a little harder because it has to feel like her and not me. This is also a good test of my barebones Bootsrap knowledge.

### Day 7: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The last few days have been blur so I am committing multiple days as one day. I am still trucking through the JS portion of FreeCodeCamp and make modifications to lakenonatech.org adding a new speaker.

**Thoughts:** The daily hustle keeps me motivated and consistency has really shown importance to learning new languages.

**Thoughts:** This past week has shown me how important a portfolio is :)

### Day 10: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I am putting the finishing touches on cognificent.tech and I might be taking on an app project using Meteor JS.

  **Thoughts:** I have lost some intensity on FreeCodeCamp.com but I am back and swinging for the fences.

### Day 11: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent majority of the day working on our site which I end up trashing lol I will now be moving the site over to Bootstrap because it will be easier to maintain then wordpress in my opinion and will be more reliable

  **Thoughts:** It really sucks to have to do a lot more dev work but I know this is the right decision. You live and your learn. Coming soon still up.

### Day 12: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have a really good plan mocked up and will finish our company site tonight! Do or die.

  **Thoughts:** Very excited about the FreeCodeCamp Boostrap knowledge that is making this a semi-piece of cake.

**Link to work:** http://cognificent.tech will be on Github pages!

### Day 13: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Our site is finished and I spent most of today on API's! I also did some dope JavaScript with Wes Bos as my guide.

  **Thoughts:** I need to do some more practical API documentation but I think I am really understanding JSON better then I have before and structured data.
