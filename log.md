### Day 0: January 04, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I am getting close to finishing my portfolio, it is modified Boostrap theme and this gave me a chance to finally learn how to use Github Pages which was on my list for like 6 months haha too fun :)

**Thoughts:** Somtimes got really frustrated with the style sheet. I want to get this thing up but in the near future I want to convert all of my styles to Sass. I also think there could be some better asset optimization.
