# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I am getting close to finishing my portfolio, it is modified Boostrap theme and this gave me a chance to finally learn how to use Github Pages which was on my list for like 6 months haha too fun :)

**Thoughts:** Somtimes got really frustrated with the style sheet. I want to get this thing up but in the near future I want to convert all of my styles to Sass. I also think there could be some better asset optimization.

### Day 1: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent my 2+ HRs on FreeCodeCamp powering through the HTML, CSS and Boostrap lessons :)

**Thoughts:** I had a decent amount of experience in all of these subjects and was surprised at how many simple techniques will help on future projects.

### Day 1: January 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent my hour today working through the jQuery lesson.

**Thoughts:** I once again had experience with jQuery but was refreshed by the clarity of the concepts. I feel like will use it to the fullest in the near future without blindly copy and pasting functions.
